# CRCAssist
Downloading the newest release will give you an installer. Executing it will download the necessary files including the soundfiles. A desctop shortcut and a home menu shortcut will be created automatically.

When creating the beat you can set
- the amount of GPs you want to do
- how fast the beat should be
- whether you want to instantly start with the first GP or want 4 kicks to get ready
- if you want the beat to transition into a CRC beat and how often the CRC beat should be played.
