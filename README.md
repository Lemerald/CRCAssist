# CRCAssist
Downloading the newest release will give you an installer. Executing it will download the necessary files including the soundfiles. A desctop shortcut and a home menu shortcut will be created automatically.

When creating the beat you can set
- the amount of GPs you want to do
- how fast the beat should be
- whether you want to instantly start with the first GP or want 4 kicks to get ready
- if you want the beat to transition into a CRC beat and how often the CRC beat should be played.

You can click the gear icon to change the delay between the soundfiles. This is usefull if the timing isn' accurate
You can click the plus icon to acces the conversion tool which can convert mashing time in seconds to groundpunds and vice versa
